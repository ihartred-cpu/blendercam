# Biesse CIX (CID3) post processor for Fabex
#
# Wraps standard ISO-style G-code as embedded ISO instructions inside a
# CIX (CID3 REL=5.0) container, matching the format Biesse's bSuite/bSolid
# accepts natively via the work list and CAD/CAM import.
#
# Confirmed against real bSuite behaviour:
#   - CID3 REL=5.0 header + MAINDATA panel block imports cleanly
#   - Standalone `BEGIN MACRO / NAME=ISO / PARAM,NAME=ISO,VALUE="..."`
#     blocks import as individual "ISO row" entries in the machining
#     operation timeline, carrying arbitrary embedded G-code text
#   - TP=<n> selects tool pocket n; TP0 releases the tool
#
# 3-axis only for now. 5-axis (G300 + B/C letters) intentionally left
# out until the indexed-rotation pipeline has been verified empirically.
